### Concept

The ultimate goal of this content is to create an ideological framework that will enable us (humans) to promote and work towards a fair and egalitarian society.

The interim goal is to provide a rectification to injustices and unfairness currently present in the ideological landscape caused by the ideological misandry often seen in feminism.

In general, the goal of this ideological framework is to present itself in opposition to anti-egalitarian ideals found in competing ideologies with the most effort targeted towards those that have or are gaining widespread acceptance and institutional influence.

Currently, this fraemwork is western centric: North America and Europe (mostly western Europe).

I (Sydnaktik) will be likely the primary contributor to this content, but anyone is encouraged to contribute. However, I ented to use heavy handed and dogmatic moderation. This is counter balanced by the fact that the entire content is licensed under MIT open source and easily copied and forked via Git. So ultimately, if too many people disagree with my moderation, they can nearly effortlessly create their own version. Conversely this puts pressure on me to engage in inclusive moderation so as to help ensure a higher number of contributors and a greater diversity of viewpoints.

That's said here are the general principle and values that will be enforced:

1. The current goal is to create an ideological framework of simultaneously promoting egalitarian principles and opposse influential ideologies. Also with a view to maximize the quality of the human condition as secondary objective. 

2. For the first 1-5 years the primary focus will be on opposing misandrist ideology. How long this remains the case will depend on the availability of additional contributors with alternative viewpoints and the level of influence of anti-egalitarian ideologies such as misogyny, homophobia, anti-secularism, anti-semitism, moral relativism etc...

3. This framework is uncompromising on the principles of rationalism. Science is its source of truth, stated principles are its moral compass. With the understanding that discussions around social behavior found in academic instutions are probably ideological in nature rather than scientific. Also with recognition that while this framework operates on the principles of rationalism, theists are to be equaly protected by the framework and encouraged to equaly participate in order to ensure that their experiences are accounted for.

4. It tries to be agnostic along a certain range of moral positions. Idealy the generated content should apply just a well for anyone or any society that adopts moral positions anywhere on the range. If on certain topics this proves to be too difficult, we should strive to create alternative versions of the content for the various competing moral positions. Some examples of moral positions that are support:
   - Both sides of the abortion debate: pro-life and pro-choice
   - Moderate liberal values
   - Moderate socialist values

5. The framework is in opposition to radical liberalism. As radical liberalism, in practice, inevitably leads to the liberal freedom to excercise power over someone else.

6. The framework is in opposition to radical socialism. As radical socialism enforces a single point of view on all individuals in society which will inevitably cause unfair suffering for a large number of individuals.

7. The framework is in opposition to radical equality. As, in practice, radical equality is equality from a single perspective which will be perceived as inequality and injustice by most other perspectives.

Striving for equality with the restrictions imposed by 5, 6 and 7 may seem like an oxymoron. However, this framework's goal isn't to achieve equality. But merely to oppose those forces that are currently acting most effectively in opposition to equality.

I expect that most potential contibutors will strongly disagree with some of the points listed. 

In summary: we're trying to contribute to the de-polarization and de-radicalization of the world with a view to increase equality and the human condition with the belief that this is best achieved on a foundation of rationalism.

### Contributing

Git and GitHub were chosen because of the decentralized nature of Git (it nearly effortless for anyone to create a complete copy of this content and start their own version of this project) and the ease of access provided by GitHub.

My goal is to make modifying content in an "open branch" as efforless as possible, similarly to a wiki. With a more curated branch that only contains validated content. The open branch would regularly be reverted back to the content of the curated branch.

Suggestions on how to manage all this are strong encouraged. Frankly, I expect to be working on this content alone for quite a while.

For now anyone wanting to contribute may do one of the following:
 - Send me a message so that I may add them as a contributor (you'll probably need a github account for this)
 - Create a fork and submit a pull request (you need to know how github/git works for this)
 - Open an issue with the changes you'd like made (you might need a github account for this too)
 - Send me a messages with the content you'd like to have added or modified and I will apply it on your behalf

Contributing in any of these ways implies that you agree to license the contributions under the MIT open source license as stated in the LICENSE file.
