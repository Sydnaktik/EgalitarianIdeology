In that document, I state:

"we need to show empathy and due consideration for the individuals involved as however misguided their ideology may be it shouldn't justify oppressive retribution"

This reflects a liberal leaning perspective. A more socialist perspective will seek to hold the individual accountable for their contribution to a group that hurts society
even when the individual is merely misguided and has mostly good intentions.

I think we'll need a more developped explanation of this situation, there are two aspects here: what tone to use with respect to groups that promote opposing ideologies.
And what the framework has to say in terms of "advice" on activism vs these groups.

In trying to keep with the ideals of this framework to be agnostic on the liberal vs socialist spectrum
we'll need to either find a more neutral presentation, or split the explanation in two. One that explains both approachs.

I think the that sticking to the approach of cleanly and as much as possible seperating the ideology from the groups and people that promote these ideologies.
While also ensuring that we provide ample content to support actvists who wish to condemn a group as a whole.
