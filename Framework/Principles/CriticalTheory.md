## Critical Theory

TODO:
  - A clear, objective, somewhat complete but succint explanation of Critical Theory
  - Explanation of a fundamental flaws of critical theory: It dehumanizes the oppressor class (setting the stage for the oppression of the "oppressor").
  It ironically lacks in critical thinking as the word "critical" is used in the sense of a critique (which in this case is intentionally done in a biased way devoid of critical thought).
  - Links to Critical Gender Theory and Critical Race Theory
  - Parrallels to the Egalitarian Ideology framework, which in practice is pretty much Critical X Theory where X is whatever ideology we've decided to oppose.
  - And development of tools and processes to avoid falling in the same trap that would be egalitarians before us have fallen into.
  - Development of tactics and rhetorics to combat the anti-egalitarian effects of Critical Theory.
