### Defining opposition groups and ideologies

People's natural inclination seems to be to oppose groups and individuals.

But the goal here is to oppose ideas.

However, presenting our understanding of the social landscape is a crucial component of our ideological framework.

As such everything should be generally worded in terms opposition to an ideology whose name we create ourselves.

We then, separately, clarify which people, organisations and labels tend to carry that ideology.

For example, there will be a lot of content describing the prevalence of misandrist ideology. We will develop many techniques to combat and discredit these misandrist concepts.

And throughout, they will be referred to as misandrist ideology, misandrist concept, misandrist ideas and misandrist tactics etc...

The explanation on the link between misandrist ideology and feminism, feminists and feminist institution will be done sperately.

However, in that same discussion, we need to show empathy and due consideration for the individuals involved as however misguided
their ideology may be it shouldn't justify oppressive retribution.
