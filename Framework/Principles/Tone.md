### Tone in this Egalitarian Framework

This framework is also a persuasion tools and as such its tone is very important.

The tone used under Framework should be strictly followed and consistent.

However, it hasen't been clearly defined yet.

General guidelines are:
 - No generalizations.
 - Keep a tone that considers empathy for all individuals.
 - We oppose ideas, we don't attack. Avoid using battle terminology. It encourages othering and dehumanization which is what we're trying to prevent.

The tone under the Discussion section can be more relaxed. However, the Code_Of_Conduct.md should be respected at all times.
