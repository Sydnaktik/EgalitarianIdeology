##Equity and how misandrist use it

Equal opportunity is the liberal interpretation of egalitarianism.

Equal outcome is the collectivist interpretation of egalitarianism.

As we try to support both interpretations it's best not to focus on completely delegitimizing Equity.

However, the argument against radical egalitarianism applies here.

Equal outcome can be considered desirable. However there is the question of by which criteria should outcomes be judged.

Misandrists will promote a set of criteria that shows that women are disadvantaged in the outcomes while ignoring those criteria where men are disadvantaged on the outcomes.

TODOs:
 - Historical analysis of the use of the misandrist application of Equity theory both in government and academia.
 - Analysis of the most recent use of misandrist equity theory in academia
 - Development of rhetorical tactics to address this topic.
