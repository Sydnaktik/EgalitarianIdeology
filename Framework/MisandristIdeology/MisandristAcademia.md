#Misandrist Academia

There's a lot of evidence to show that Academia is overrun with misandrist ideology and policies.

From student body regulations to academic papers.

TODOs:
We need a collection of sources to document these infractions.
We need a historical view of how things have progressed.
We need an accurate investigation of what is happening in social and gender studies academic research.
My expectation is that "research" happens with a female primacy mindset, everything must be done from a perspective of benefitting women.
My expectation furthermore is that there have been opposition forces at work to counteract this mindset and as a result academic content has mellowed out in
terms of the level and blatantness of misandry due to pushback from anti-misandrists and rationalists, however it has gotten more complicated and convoluted as
misandrists keep developping workarounds to ensure that academia keeps producing content that will be consistent with legislative and regulatory action that
will be exclusively to the benefit of women, typically at the expense of men.

There's a lot of work to be done here and a historical analysis should help to present a clear narative.

Of course, this is still speculative as an investigation still needs to be done. We will need to adjust our ideological response according to the reality we uncover.
