# The misandry pipeline

This is a stub article for a theoretical model of how many fall into deep levels of misandry.

The general steps are:
 1. Experience of misogyny, or constant exposure to anecdotes or propaganda that promotes the idea of a general prevalence of misogyny.
 2. Exposure to the idealogy of male privilege
 3. Exposure to the ideology of toxic masculinity
 4. Internalized misandry
