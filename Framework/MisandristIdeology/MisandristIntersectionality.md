#Misandrist Intersectionality

This is a stub document discussing intersectionality and it's use to promote misandry.

TODOs:
- Intersectionality has a legitimate principle. For example most issues men faced are magnified when faced by black men.
- There seems to be a sort of ideology to application pipepline that enables misandrists to leverage intersectionality concepts to, for example, turn a reality
of oppression on black men into laws and regulations that will confer additional protection and privileges for white women. The usual path is
  - black men suffer
  - intersectionality of black and women applied and overdramatized and emphasis placed on gender
  - Laws and regulations regulations passed to protect women and minorities
  - Bureaucracy applies these laws and regulation to benefit white women the most
  - We need clear evidence of the existence of this pipeline (if it exists).
  - We need historical information on intersectional theory in academia, how it has changed over time and what it looks like today.
  - We need rhetorical tools to deal with the way intersectional theory is used to perpetuate misandry (provided we have evidence that it actually happens).
